<h1>ASSIGNMENT 4 README</h1>
<ol>
<li><i>WHAT IS ALT TEXT?</i> Alt text is alternative text for an image with a broken link or that is otherwise unavailable. This text informs the user what <i>should</i> be there.</li>
<li>I've come across forms in my web use basically every day. The most obvious and prevalent use of them is for online shopping. Users must fill out their shipping and billing information across multiple forms that incorporate multiple types of data(CC info, phone numbers, addresses). </li>
<li>This assignment took me more time than the previous assignments have, but I think that is just because there were many different requirements to fulfill. I am definitely feeling comfortable using Atom for both Markdown and HTML, and I'm beginning to see how all the various parts of HTML work together. I liked building some structural page elements this week, even if they were fairly simple fieldsets and tables. This is all helping me understand what makes web pages actually work and I've been fascinated by viewing page sources on some of my favorite websites.
