# ASSIGNMENT 2
Version control systems keep track of changes to a file or collections of files over time. Known as VCS, these systems can be an independent app or a function of a larger program. These can allow users to reference specific revisions in a file's history. Wikipedia's page history tool is an example of a built-in VCS.

MY [RESPONSES](/assignment-2/responses.txt)

This assignment was very enjoyable for me. The pace of information was easy to keep up with and everything was explained/demonstrated fully. I really like having lessons I can directly follow along with, and having constant assignments within Atom gives me a lot of hand-on time with the software.
